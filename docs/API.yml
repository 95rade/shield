  # SHIELD v2 API

  This document specifies the behavior of the SHIELD API, version 2,
  in its entirety.  This is a specification, not merely
  documentation &mdash; it is the authoritative source.  If this
  document is unclear, it will be amended.  If the SHIELD codebase
  disagrees with this specification, the code is incorrect and
  should be treated as such.

  The purpose of this document is to allow 3rd party integrators to
  inter-operate with the SHIELD API without resorting to spelunking
  through its implementation.

  ## Error Handling

  The SHIELD API returns errors by using non-200 HTTP status codes,
  as follows:

    - **500** - An internal error has occurred; details will be
      present in the SHIELD Core server error log.  The response
      will contain a sanitized error message, using the standard
      format (described below).

    - **400** - Something about the HTTP request was invalid or
      incorrect.  This may occur if a JSON payload was expected,
      but not provided, required keys in theat payload were missing,
      or values supplied were incorrect, out-of-range, etc.

    - **404** - The requested resource was not found.  An error
      (in the standard format) will be returned.

    - **401** - The requester is not authenticated to the SHIELD
      API, but has requested a protected endpoint.  The request
      may be retried after authenticating.

    - **403** - The requester is authenticated but has requested
      an endpoint that they do lack the rights to access.  This
      request should not be retried.

  Regardless of the HTTP status code used, the SHIELD API will
  always include a JSON payload with more details, in either the
  **Standard Format** or the **Missing Values Format**.

  ### Standard Format for Error Reporting

  The **Standard Format** for error reporting consists of a
  top-level JSON object containing a single key, `error`, that
  contains a human-readable error message, suitable for display.

  Example:

  ```json
  {
    "error": "No such retention policy"
  }
  ```

  This format is used for all non-validation error reporting.

  ### Missing Values Format for Error Reporting

  The **Missing Values Format** for error reporting is used for
  reporting request validation errors where required fields in the
  request payload are missing.  It consists of a top-level JSON
  object containing a single key, `missing`, which is set to a list
  of field names that must be sent in the request, but were not.

  Example:

  ```json
  {
    "missing": [
      "name",
      "endpoint",
      "agent"
    ]
  }
  ```

  The order of the fields is inconsequential.

              SHIELD site administrator).

            - **uuid** - The internal UUID assigned to this agent by the SHIELD Core.

            - **address** - The `host:port` of the agent, from the
              point-of-view of the SHIELD Core.

            - **version - The version of the remote SHIELD Agent's software.

            - **status - The health status of the remote SHIELD
              Agent, one of `ok` or `failing`.

            - **hidden - Whether or not this agent has been administratively hidden.

            - **last\_error - TBD

            - **last\_seen\_at - When the remote SHIELD Agent last

            The top-level `problems` key maps agent UUIDs to a list of errors detected
            statically by the SHIELD Core software.  Each problem is represented as an
            English-language description of the underlying issue.  SHIELD reports these
            problems to assist site administrators who may be running heterogenous
            versions of the SHIELD Core and SHIELD Agent software.  In these
            environments, issues may arise due to version incompatibility.  Newer
            versions of the SHIELD Core may also be able to inform administrators about
            known deficiencies in older version of the SHIELD Agent and SHIELD plugins.

            **NOTE:** `problems` are reported by the SHIELD Core; it is perfectly
            acceptable for an agent to report itself as healthy, but for the SHIELD Core
            to assert that a problem exists.

      Storage systems are essential to any data protection efforts,
      since the protected data must reside elsewhere, on another system
      in order to be truly safe.  Stores provide definitions of external
      storage system where backup archives will be kept.

      **NOTE:** the API endpoints in this section deal exclusively with
      tenant-scoped storage systems.  For information on the endpoints

      Jobs are discrete, schedulable backup operations that tie together a

    intro: |
      Tasks represent the context, status, and output of the execution of
      some operation, be it a scheduled backup job being run, an ad hoc
      restore operation, etc.

      Since tasks represent internal state, they cannot easily be created or
      updated via operators.  Instead, the execution of the job, or the
      triggering of some other action, will cause a task to spring into
      existence and move through its lifecycle.
